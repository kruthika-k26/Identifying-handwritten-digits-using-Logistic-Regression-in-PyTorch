The project "Identifying Handwritten Digits Using Logistic Regression in PyTorch" demonstrates how to use logistic regression for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, a standard dataset in machine learning. The model takes 28x28 pixel images, flattens them into a 784-dimensional vector, and outputs probabilities for each of the 10 possible digits (0-9). Using PyTorch, the dataset is preprocessed and normalized, and the model is trained using cross-entropy loss and stochastic gradient descent. The project walks through the process of building, training, and evaluating the logistic regression model, providing a clear introduction to image classification tasks. While effective for simple tasks, the project also highlights how more complex models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) could be used for improved performance on more challenging datasets.
